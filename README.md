# Monkey Madness

## Overview

**Monkey Madness** is a game I made in 8 days. **Inspired by Experimental gameplay project monthly them of January 2010: 
"100 Things"**. I have been following these guys and I think it is such a great experiment to force yourself to make  a game-prototype in short time. This give the focus needed to squeeze new ideas and results.

**You must prevent your jungle tree to be destroyed by, HOW NOT, 100 ANGRY MONKEYS**. The monkeys will attack and try to break the branches. You must shake them to and send this horrible creatures back to the jungle!

**Objective**: Survive the attack of 100 monkeys and prevent them from destroying all your tree branches. 

Get rid of the monkeys by throwing them out of the screen and back to the jungle from your tree. If you knock out a monkey, it will wake up after a time and continue trying to destory your tree!

- Simple: Use your mouse to click and drag any branch of your tree, thus shaking it. This will make any monkey to be thrown away if the speed and angle are correct.

## Known bugs
THIS GAME WAS MADE A BIT IN A RUSH TO GET EVERYTHING DONE IN 8 DAYS, A BIT MORE OF THE TIMESPAN RECOMMENDED BY EGP. SO, THERE ARE SOME BUGS WHICH NEED FURTHER PLAY ON MY PART TO DETECT WHERE THEY COME FROM:

- SOMETIMES MONKEY AI, AFTER KNOCKOUT, STANDS AND DOESNT MOVE TO A BRANCH. IT CHANGES WHEN ANOTHER MONKEY IS GOING
THROUGH THIS ONE.
- MISCELLANEOUS (ALBEIT SMALL) CRASHES (BETTER YOU DONT KNOW WHY... ;) )

MONKEY MADNESS IS A GAME MADE IN 8 DAYS. INSPIRED BY EXPERIMENTAL GAMEPLAY PROJECT MONTHLY THEME OF JANUARY 2010: 100 THINGS.
IN THIS GAME YOU MUST PREVENT YOUR JUNGLE TREE TO BE DESTROYED BY, HOW NOT, 100 ANGRY MONKEYS. THE MONKEYS WILL ATTACK AND TRY
TO BREAK THE BRANCHES, AND YOU MUST SHAKE THEM AND SEND THIS HORRIBLE CREATURES BACK TO THE JUNGLE!

OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE THE ATTACK OF 100 MONKEYS AND PREVENT THEM FROM DESTROYING ALL YOUR TREE BRANCHES. 

GET RID OF THE MONKEYS THROWING THEM OUT OF THE SCREEN AND BACK TO THE JUNGLE FROM YOUR TREE. IF YOU KNOCK OUT A MONKEY, IT
WILL WAKE UP AFTER A TIME AND CONTINUE TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR TREE!

**********CONTROLS**********:
SIMPLE: USE YOUR MOUSE TO CLICK AND DRAG ANY BRANCH OF YOUR TREE. THIS WILL MAKE ANY MONKEY TO BE THROWN. 


********KNOWN BUGS:*********:
THIS GAME WAS MADE A BIT IN A RUSH TO GET EVERYTHING DONE IN 8 DAYS, A BIT MORE OF THE TIMESPAN RECOMMENDED BY 
EGP. SO, THERE ARE SOME BUGS WHICH NEED FURTHER PLAY ON MY PART TO DETECT WHERE THEY COME FROM:

- SOMETIMES MONKEY AI, AFTER KNOCKOUT, STANDS AND DOESNT MOVE TO A BRANCH. IT CHANGES WHEN ANOTHER MONKEY IS GOING
THROUGH THIS ONE.
- MISCELLANEOUS (ALBEIT SMALL) CRASHES (BETTER YOU DONT KNOW WHY... ;) )
